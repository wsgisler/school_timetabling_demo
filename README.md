# School Timetabling Demo

Background: I am coaching a group of students at HSLU (http://hslu.ch) who is developing a school timetabling software as part of their Bachelor's program in AI and ML.

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that illustrate how a very simple timetabling problem can be modelled using mixed integer programming (using Cplex) or constraint programming (Using Google OR-Tools). The problem at hand consists of scheduling lectures for two classes only. A couple of side-constraints (e.g. don't schedule a sports lecture twice within 3 days etc.) are introduced to make things more interesting and to show how basic constraints can be added.

I kept the comments in German but the variable names etc. are entirely in English, so I think it might still be understandable for non-German speakers.
